# Number Guessing
This is one of the simple python projects yet an exciting one. You can even call it a mini-game. Make a program in which the computer randomly chooses a number between 1 to 10, 1 to 100, or any range. Then give users a hint to guess the number. Every time the user guesses wrong, he gets another clue, and his score gets reduced. The clue can be multiples, divisible, greater or smaller, or a combination of all.

# Tought Process
- I choose to the game to be a number between 1-10 
- I created a start function, that's where the Game starts from
- After which the game function will be called to start the game proper
- They is variable count that increases everytime the game function is called so it will determine the hint to give the player if the player doesn't get the number at first guess
- i made use of the inbuild random function too genrate a random number in two places
